# Clear Writing (Simplified Technical English)

Guidance for writing or rewriting technical text so it is short, unambiguous, and easy to
translate or skim. Based on the writing-rule principles of ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical
English), adapted here as general guidance rather than a reproduction of the licensed standard —
see "On the controlled dictionary" below.

Applies to both directions:
- **Drafting**: writing new procedures, docs, or instructions from a blank page.
- **Rewriting**: taking existing text and tightening it to these rules.

## Core rules

**One idea per sentence.** Never join two instructions or two facts with "and," "then," or a
semicolon if they can be two sentences instead. A procedure step does one thing.

**Active voice, not passive.** "Tighten the bolt," not "The bolt should be tightened." The actor
performs the action; don't hide it.

**Imperative mood for instructions.** "Open the file." Not "You should open the file" or "The
file should be opened."

**Simple tenses only.** Present tense for facts and descriptions ("The function returns a list").
Past simple for what happened. Future simple for what will happen. Avoid perfect and progressive
tenses ("has been configured," "will be running") — say what is true now or what to do now.

**Short sentences.** Target ~20 words for instructions, ~25 for descriptive/explanatory text.
If a sentence needs a comma to hold two clauses together, it is very often two sentences.

**Short paragraphs.** One topic per paragraph, generally under ~6 sentences. Break up anything
longer.

**No noun stacks.** "The user authentication configuration file" → "the file that configures
user authentication," or better, just name it directly ("the auth config file") on first mention
and reuse that name.

**No gerunds as nouns.** Avoid "the loading of the file failed" — say "the file did not load" or
"loading failed" is still acceptable as a verb form, but don't build noun phrases out of -ing
words when a plain verb sentence works.

**Use "of," not the possessive apostrophe, for technical relationships.** "The speed of the
process," not "the process's speed." (Plain possessives for people/ownership in ordinary prose
are fine — this rule is about avoiding ambiguous stacked possessives in technical description.)

**No ambiguous pronoun reference.** If "it," "this," or "that" could refer to more than one noun
in the previous sentence, replace the pronoun with the actual noun.

**Say why before what, only if needed — otherwise just say what.** Don't pad instructions with
unnecessary justification. If a step needs a reason (e.g., a safety or data-loss concern), put
the reason in its own sentence, before the instruction it explains, so the reader has context
before acting.

**No idioms, humor, or culturally-specific phrasing.** Avoid "under the hood," "at the end of the
day," rhetorical questions, sarcasm. Say the literal thing.

**No unnecessary synonyms.** Pick one term per concept and reuse it throughout a document. Don't
vary vocabulary for style ("delete," "remove," "erase" for the same action) — pick one and use it
every time.

**Spell out procedure structure explicitly.** Numbered steps for sequences that must happen in
order. Bulleted lists for unordered sets. A warning/caution that precedes the step it protects
against, on its own line, clearly marked (e.g. "**Warning:** ..." / "**Caution:** ...").

## Vocabulary

Prefer short, common, everyday words over long or Latinate ones when both mean the same thing:
"use" not "utilize," "start" not "initiate," "help" not "facilitate," "show" not "demonstrate."

Give each concept exactly one term and use it consistently — don't let "the setting," "the
option," "the parameter," and "the flag" all refer to the same thing in one document.

Prefer concrete, specific verbs over vague ones: "click," "type," "select" rather than "use" or
"do" or "handle" when a more precise word exists.

### On the controlled dictionary

The full ASD-STE100 standard also defines a fixed dictionary of ~900 approved general words, each
locked to one approved meaning and one part of speech. That dictionary is a licensed ASD
publication and is not reproduced here — don't claim output is dictionary-compliant STE. Apply
the spirit of it (few words, one meaning each, no needless synonyms) using ordinary judgment.

If the user provides a copy of the licensed dictionary or word list (e.g., as a file in this
skill's directory or pasted into the conversation), treat it as authoritative and check
vocabulary choices against it.

## Workflow

**When rewriting existing text:**
1. Read the whole passage first — don't rewrite sentence-by-sentence blind to context.
2. Rewrite following the rules above.
3. Briefly flag anything that changed meaning, not just phrasing (e.g., a hedge or qualifier that
   got dropped) — the user needs to know if simplification touched the actual content.

**When drafting new text:**
1. If the audience, purpose, or required level of formality isn't clear from context, ask rather
   than guessing — a safety procedure and a casual internal note follow the same sentence-length
   rules but very different tone.
2. Draft directly in the style described above — don't draft normally and simplify after.

**Self-check before returning output** — scan for:
- Any sentence over ~20-25 words
- Any passive-voice construction
- Any sentence doing more than one thing
- Any pronoun with an ambiguous referent
- Any term used two different ways, or two terms used for the same thing

## Example

**Before:**
> The configuration file, which is typically located in the user's home directory, should be
> edited before the application is started, and it's important that any changes that are made
> are saved prior to launching, otherwise they won't be picked up and the default settings will
> be used instead.

**After:**
> The config file is normally in your home directory. Edit it before you start the application.
> Save your changes before you start the application. If you do not save your changes, the
> application uses the default settings instead.
